# Streaming

I want to learn about using TCP/UDP to stream data in chunks/datagrams, whatever they are called, across the wire!
Maybe when I eventually learn an actual systems programming language will I approach closer to the metal, but for now...we'll use Go because it's just too noob friendly. If this repo is dead, that means this is another dead project, but making it public makes me want to take some accountability.

Look at this little guy, he's adorable:
